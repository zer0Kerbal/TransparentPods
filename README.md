#### Parts:
+ 2.5m **Panopticon** Command Pod
+ 1.25m **Cyclops** Command Pod
+ 0.625m **Mono** Pressurized Command Chair
+ ~0.2m Micro Lander Leg; radial and ventral mount configurations
+ ~0.3m **Micro Klaw** Micro Advanced Grabber Unit.
+ Handrail
+ Handrail, short

#### Known issues:
 + Having multiple transparent pods in physics range is very resource intensive. Too many will crash the game.
 + Flight HUD will render Black instead of Green in OpenGL mode.
 + Lighting direction from Sun incorrect in IVA at some parts of day, due to Squad's funky IVA orientation setup.
 + One of the stack nodes on Mono Pod will snap to, but not attach to other stack nodes, if the Mono Pod is not the root part.
 + Micro lander legs clip into ground if retract/deployed while landed. same appears to happen with the smallest stock lander leg.
